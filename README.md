# M3_Wiper-control-System
A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The current system required manual wiper activation,by changing the Speed frequency of wiper. As a results the operation of bringing up the wiper speed is varied . The project's goals are to improve ageing car's systems by giving automated control for wiper system, to improve the system by incorporating a sensor and actuator and to create a simple system framework.
